# Align on the purpose of blueprints 

## Summary

This RFC proposes some ideals for blueprints that we can keep in mind while making changes to the blueprints, and how folks upgrading should think about blueprints as well.

## Motivation

There has been some disagreements with what changes to make to which blueprints, and how they should be used, and how we should think about them. This RFC aims to gain alignment on the purpose of blueprints, so we can all better collaborate.

## Detailed design

Blueprints should be the Ember community's recommendation for an ideal starting point for a new app.

Today (2024-10-28), whis would mean these should be default in the blueprint:
- embroider 
- template-imports (pending: [RFC #1046 : Template Tag in Routes](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/1046))
- Glint @ unstable (if using TypeScript and no hbs is present (See RFC #1046))

Some of these may _seem_ uncanny (e.g.: `unstable`) -- but the specifics of what happens with the blueprint are outside of scope for this RFC.



> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here. 

> Please keep in mind any implications within the Ember ecosystem, such as:
> - Lint rules (ember-template-lint, eslint-plugin-ember) that should be added, modified or removed
> - Features that are replaced or made obsolete by this feature and should eventually be deprecated
> - Ember Inspector and debuggability
> - Server-side Rendering
> - Ember Engines
> - The Addon Ecosystem
> - IDE Support
> - Blueprints that should be added or modified

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Ember patterns, or as a
wholly new one?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Ember guides must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how Ember is taught to new users
at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Ember
users?

> Keep in mind the variety of learning materials: API docs, guides, blog posts, tutorials, etc.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Ember,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
